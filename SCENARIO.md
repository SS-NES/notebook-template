# Jupyter Notebook Template for Research software

This is an example of a Jupyter notebook template created using the meta template. 
The idea behind using the meta template to 
create this Jupyter notebook template is to easily adopt 
best software development practices for the NES domain. 
By using the meta template licenses, CODEOFCONDUCT.md, README.md among other files were added without the need of adding them manually when creating this template.


The main audience for this template are users who wish to create/ have created a data analysis project. 
As such the structure of the template was slightly altered while adhering to best software 
development practices for NES. T

The changes in folder structure include:
- Inclusion of a `data` folder
- Inclusion of a `notebooks` folder with a template notebook. 
This notebook contains placeholders such that the notebook is adjusted according to the user's copier answers when using this template to create their own project. 
- A `tests` folder
