# Jupyter Notebook Template for Research software

This Jupyter notebook template was generated using the meta template 
to streamline the adoption of best software development practices in the NES domain.

By leveraging the meta template, essential files that help a project adhere to the FAIR principles
such as licenses, CODEOFCONDUCT.md, README.md, 
and others were automatically included, eliminating the need for manual setup.

## Purpose
This template is designed for users creating or managing data analysis projects i
n Jupyter notebooks. 
While maintaining NES best practices, the structure was 
slightly adjusted to better fit the needs of notebook-based workflows.

## Structural Adjustments
To align with typical Jupyter-based research workflows, 
the following modifications were made:

- `data/` folder – To store datasets used in analysis.
- `notebooks/` folder – Contains a template notebook with placeholders that dynamically adjust based on user input during project creation.
- `tests/` folder – For organizing and running validation tests on code or data processing steps.

This ensures a structured, reproducible, and well-documented environment for research software development.
